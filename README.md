# Movie_recommendor_syst
This is a Movie recommendor system that uses a **content based learning** system to suggest similar movies based on user suggestion given through user input

This uses the simple concept of making "**movie tags**",meaning information about the movie like the actors,directors,genre etc , and turning these "**movie tags**" into vectors, so it is easier to compare similar movies using the distance between the vectors

if your interested ,you can try the app out yourself https://movierecommendorsyst-7sw0m172fxn.streamlit.app/
