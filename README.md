# Movie Recommender System

Welcome to the Movie Recommender System! This project is a content-based recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a user-specified movie. The system uses movie metadata such as actors, directors, genres, etc., to generate movie recommendations.

## Overview

This movie recommender system uses a content-based filtering approach. By converting movie metadata into "movie tags" and transforming these tags into vectors, the system can compare movies based on the distance between their vectors. This enables it to recommend movies that are similar to the one specified by the user.

## Features

- Content-based filtering to suggest movies.
- Utilizes movie metadata such as actors, directors, genres, and more.
- Easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
    cd movie-recommender-system
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.
2. Enter the name of a movie you like.
3. The system will recommend similar movies based on the content-based filtering.

## How it Works

1. **Data Loading**: The system loads movie data from CSV files.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: It processes the data to extract relevant information such as genres, cast, crew, etc.
3. **Tag Creation**: The system creates "movie tags" by combining various metadata.
4. **Vectorization**: These tags are transformed into vectors.
5. **Similarity Calculation**: It calculates the similarity between movies using the cosine similarity between their vectors.
6. **Recommendation**: Based on the similarity scores, the system recommends movies that are closest to the user-specified movie.

## Improvements

Here are some potential improvements to enhance the recommender system:

- **Incorporate More Features**: Including additional features like user ratings, release year, etc., can improve recommendations.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combining content-based filtering with collaborative filtering to leverage user interaction data.
- **Optimization**: Improving the efficiency of data processing and similarity calculations.
- **User Interface**: Enhancing the Streamlit app interface for a better user experience.
